# 3DCatalystModeling

## Purpose

A general-use 3D solver for coupled gas-phase and aqueous-phase transport/reactions in electroredution catalysts with intermixed hydrophobic and hydrophilic catalysts. The type of catalyst we model/simulate is of the type studied in [this recent paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsenergylett.2c01978). Hydrophobic (porous PTFE) and hydrophilic (porous Cu) domains are interspersed randomly, creating pathways for transport of gaseous and aqueous species, respectively. The Cu phase acts as a catalyst for reduction of CO and CO2 to form simple hydrocarbons, while the PTFE phase helps overcome gas transport limitations in pure Cu catalysts. In this work, we perform geometric restructuring to retain the essential physicochemical dynamicsand scales present in the problem while simplifying the simulation considerably. We are able to recast the problem as a simple unit-problem using a 3D, structured, rectilinear mesh. This page offers a snapshot into the code we use to perform these simulations.
